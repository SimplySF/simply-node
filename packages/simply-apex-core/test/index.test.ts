/**
 * Pins down this package's public API surface. Types are erased at runtime and so can't be checked
 * here — TypeScript's own compilation of this file is what would catch a type export being removed
 * or renamed. This test guards the *value* exports (functions, classes, constants) that survive to
 * runtime.
 *
 * Updating this list is expected when the API deliberately grows. A test failure from a removed or
 * renamed key is the signal to treat the change as breaking (see `src/index.ts`'s header comment).
