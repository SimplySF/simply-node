// Everything exported from this file is this package's public API and is semver-covered: adding an
// export is a minor/patch change, but removing or renaming one is breaking. `test/index.test.ts`
// pins the exported-key list down so an accidental removal fails a test instead of silently shipping
// in a patch release. See docs/design/0032-simply-package-core.md for why this package is split out
// from `@simplysf/simply-package` (the CLI) rather than being one more relative import inside it.
