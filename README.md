# Simply Node

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache_2.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)

A collection of framework-independent Node/TypeScript libraries for working with Salesforce, built by [SimplySF](https://github.com/SimplySF). Each package is a plain library with no CLI dependency — install it and call its functions directly from a script, an editor extension, a CI job, or any other Node codebase.

## Packages

This repository is a monorepo. Eleven packages are published independently to npm:
